## Projects
**Used Car Price Prediction** | https://github.com/haydenchang/Used-car-price-prediction.git

_Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, SMOTE_
* Build regression models that predicts used car price using factors such as mileage, year, accident history, ownership and car type.
* Compared five models : Gradient Boosting reduced RMSE by 15% and improved r^2 by 0.12 compared to Ridge, outperforming Linear and Lasso regression
* Utilized SMOTE for class balancing and feature engineering to improve generalization

**Fraud Detection System** | https://github.com/haydenchang/Fraud-Dection-System.git

_Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, SMOTE_
* Developed a binary classification pipeline to identify fraudulent transactions, accomplishing 92% accuracy using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.
* Utilized SMOTE to counteract severe class imbalance and improved recall by 20% compared to baseline models.
